# LineFollowerBot
Line follower prototype is an Arduino Uno based robot that chase the black strip path on a white
surface. The path can be visible like a black line. Sensing a line and maneuvering the robot to
stay on course, while constantly correcting wrong moves using feedback from the sensor forms
a simple yet effective system.
